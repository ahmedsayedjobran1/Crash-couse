        <p>Coffee is a drink prepared from roasted coffee beans. Darkly colored, bitter, and slightly acidic, coffee has
            a
            stimulating effect on humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It has the highest sales in the world
            market for
            hot drinks.[3]

            Seeds of the Coffea plant's fruits are separated to produce unroasted green coffee beans. The beans are
            roasted and then
            ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered out, producing a
            cup of coffee.
            It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Coffee can be prepared and presented in
            a variety
            of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caff√® latte, or already-brewed canned coffee). Sugar, sugar
            substitutes, milk,
            and cream are often used to mask the bitter taste or enhance the flavor.

            Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied closely to food traditions around the
            Red Sea. The
            earliest credible evidence of coffee drinking in the form of the modern beverage appears in modern-day Yemen
            from the
            mid-15th century in Sufi shrines, where coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to
            current
            methods. The Yemenis procured the coffee beans from the Ethiopian Highlands via coastal Somali
            intermediaries and began
            cultivation. By the 16th century, the drink had reached the rest of the Middle East and North Africa, later
            spreading to
            Europe. In the 20th century, coffee became a global commodity, creating different coffee cultures around the
            world.

            The two most commonly grown coffee bean types are C. arabica and C. robusta.[4] Coffee plants are cultivated
            in over 70
            countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and
            Africa. As
            of 2018, Brazil was the leading grower of coffee beans, producing 35% of the world's total. Green, unroasted
            coffee is
            traded as an agricultural commodity. Despite sales of coffee reaching billions of dollars worldwide, farmers
            producing
            coffee beans disproportionately live in poverty. Critics of the coffee industry have also pointed to its
            negative impact
            on the environment and the clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use.</p>
